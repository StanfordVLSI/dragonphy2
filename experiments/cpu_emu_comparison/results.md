* Emulation with 16x channels on ZC706, using a macro model for analog_core that computes all of the ADC samples in parallel.  This measurement used a history length of 32 bits, processed over 4 cycles in chunks of size 8.  For this experiment, "flatten_hierarchy" was set to "none" since this had solved a synthesis issue in the previous emulation architecture.  However, this may have caused the resource utilization to be high.

* First experiment with Gaussian noise -- there is an issue in this particular implementation having to do with LFSR seeding, since all of the analog_slices unfortunately are using the same seeds (although within each slice, the seeds for the sampling time and ADC noise are different).  Emulation with 16x channels on ZC706, using a macro model for analog_core that computes all of the ADC samples in parallel.  This measurement used a history length of 32 bits, processed over 4 cycles in chunks of size 8.  For this experiment, "flatten_hierarchy" was set to "rebuilt" (default from Vivado).

  * In CPU simulation, the max jitter is "31" (3.1ps) and max noise is "658" (65.8mV); the observation period is approximately 10,000 bits.  In emulation, which is running about 2 billion bits over 30 seconds, the max jitter is reduced to "23" (2.3ps) and max noise is reduced to "564" (56.4mV).  The "maximum" in this case is the highest value of the parameter that yields no bit errors over the observation period, with the other noise sources set to "0".

  * Interesting to observe that slightly higher noise is tolerated in this setup, particularly for jitter.  Possibly due to the Gaussian tail distortion in the emulator, or differences in the channel model (PWL LPF in simulation vs. PWL lookup table superposition).
